### Development notes

-   Basic car physics: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/WheelColliderTutorial.html
-   Info about physics hinges: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-HingeJoint.html
-   The car body has a boxCollider attached to it - this is required! Without it the car body will start spinning randomly and sink into the
    ground and never be seen again
